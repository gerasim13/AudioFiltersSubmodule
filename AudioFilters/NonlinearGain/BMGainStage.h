//
//  A gain stage has three components:
//    1. a gain boost
//    2. a slow limiter that emulates a vacuum tube
//    3. a lowpass filter for anti-aliasing the limiter output
//
//  BMGainStage responds well to input dynamics, giving harsher tone as you
//  drive the input harder, provided the input stays in the range [-1,1].
//  You may drive it harder to get more extreme distortion but then, of course,
//  the response will be less dynamic and may require oversampling to reduce
//  aliasing noise.
//
//  What is slow-limiting? A slow limiter attempts to put a hard limit on the
//  output signal amplitude, but makes changes to the gain reduction slowly,
//  rather than responding immediately to spikes in input amplitude. On an
//  oscilloscope, the response to a sine wave is higher on the leading edge and
//  lower on the trailing edge of the wave peaks. It produces a heavy
//  distortion at low frequencies but at high frequencies, we get a simple gain
//  reduction, with very little distortion at all.
//
//  BMGainStage is designed to be cascaded in series to produce harder clipping
//  with reduced aliasing.  When cascading gain stages, keep the input volume
//  strictly in [-1,1] and set the gain of all stages in the cascade to the same
//  value.  This evenly distributes the distortion over all stages in the
//  cascade, which is important for reducing aliasing.  If one of the gain
//  stages in a cascade is driven harder at the input than the others, that one
//  will produce more aliasing than the others, hence you need a higher sample
//  rate to avoid aliasing noise.  By keeping the input gain below 1 and
//  applying equal gain boost to all stages in the cascade, you ensure that each
//  gain stage contributes the same amount of aliasing noise, hence reducing the
//  need for oversampling.
//
//  If used in a series of FOUR gain stages, we can get 2^8 gain boost without
//  noticeable aliasing noise on guitar sounds, no need for oversampling.
//
//    (4x gain boost x 4 gain stages = 4^4 = 2^8)
