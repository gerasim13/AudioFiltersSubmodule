/*
 * These smoothing filters are based on the design by Andrew Simper:
 * https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/SvfLinearTrapOptimised2.pdf
 *
 * We have modified his design so that the attack and release portions of
 * the smoothing operation are done with separate filters that can be configured
 * with differing cutoff frequencies and Q factors. When these filters switch
 * into operation, they set their internal state variables so that the function
 * value and gradient remain continuous.
 *
 * the struct below belongs to a smoothing filter that works only while the
 * signal amplitude is decreasing
